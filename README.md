An improved Scottish FOI disclosure log index and search

See the blog post here which gives a history and outline plan: http://watty62.co.uk/2014/10/a-scotland-wide-foi-search-facility/

The file "multipage-ocr.py" was sourced from https://github.com/themathpath/multipage-ocr

We also need to incorporate the files from the first FOIAawiki - https://github.com/irl/foiawiki
